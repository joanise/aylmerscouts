    <h1>Fundraising events fall 2024 – 1st Aylmer Scouts</h1>
    <p>Fundraising helps make Scouting more affordable, supporting camps, materials and special events for all. This
        fall, 3 fundraisers are active. Please consider whether one of these might be of interest to you, and you are
        invited to spread the word to the wider community.</p>

    <h2 id="oranges">Oranges and grapefruit</h2>
    <p>This is our 3rd year with the citrus fundraiser. This year we are aiming to have orders delivered in time for
        Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
        The quality of the fruit has been excellent, as it arrives fresh from the orchard. If you have room to
        refrigerate, fruit will keep at least a month. Our supplier is <a href="https://www.orangebarn.ca/">The Orange
            Barn</a>, and they import directly from California (oranges) and Texas (grapefruit). Typically, there are
        72 oranges in a 40 lb case. Grapefruit numbers are more variable, but you can expect around 36-40 in a 40 lb
        case. Case prices are competitive with grocery store prices – you may want to consider splitting one with a
        friend.
    </p>
    <p>
        Order deadline is <b>November 10</b>. Expect to pick up your order in Aylmer the week of December 9. An exact
        date will be shared once our delivery is scheduled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment can be made by e-transfer to <a href="mailto:oranges@aylmerscouts.ca">oranges@aylmerscouts.ca</a>.
        If you would like to support a particular section, give us the name of your salesperson or let us know which
        section (Beavers, Cubs, Scouts or Venturers).
